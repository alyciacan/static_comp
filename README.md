# Static Comp: My Donkey Diary
Flexing my CSS muscles ðŸ’ª and solving real-world problems. 

## About the Project
_______

Are you, like me, forever observing donkeys and wishing you had some sort of digital repository to record these magical moments? 


...No?


That's okay. Actually, this was a solo project in which I was asked to build a static page that maintained the layout and design of a given comp. Here's the comp I was given: 
<img height="45%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105533317/189502772-54aa55bb-f1e1-4096-8b2a-676b2c47474b.png">
